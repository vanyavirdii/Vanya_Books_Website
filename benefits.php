				<h3>Reading strengthens your brain</h3>
				
				<p>
					Using MRI scans, researchers have confirmed that reading involves a complex network of circuits and signals in the brain. As your reading ability matures, those
					networks also get stronger and more sophisticated. Brain scans showed that throughout the reading period and for days afterward, brain connectivity increased, especially in
					the somatosensory cortex, the part of the brain that responds to physical sensations like movement and pain.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Reduces Stress</h3>
				
				<p>
					In 2009, a group of researchers measured the effects of yoga, humor, and reading on the stress levels of students in demanding health science programs in the United States. The study found that 30 minutes of reading lowered blood pressure, heart rate, and feelings of psychological distress just as effectively as yoga and humor did.

				<h3>Helps alleviate depression symptoms</h3>
				
				<p>
					Reading fiction can allow you to temporarily escape your own world and become swept up in the imagined experiences of the characters. And nonfiction self-help books can teach
					you strategies that may help you manage symptoms.
				</p>
				
				<h3>Memory Improvement and Better Focus</h3>
				
				<p>
					This point is stated by NCU on their blog. Reading at least a little each day can improve your focus and your memory function. In this instance as well, reading stimulates
					the brain, particularly the part of the brain that helps with memory and attention. Just like with physical exercise, reading is a form of mental exercise that pushes your
					memory and focus to the limits.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					Because the part of the brain that controls memory is stimulated, it acts like exercise for this part of the brain, resulting in improved memory.  Your focus is strengthened
					through reading because it requires focus to read. When sitting down to read a book or article, you will not understand what you are reading unless youâ€™re focused. Like the
					memory function in your brain, your focus is exercised, which helps to improve your overall focus.
